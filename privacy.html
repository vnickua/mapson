<h1>MapsON Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> April 12, 2025</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy describes how the application developer ("we", "us", or "our") handles information in the "MapsON" mobile application (the "App").</p>

<h2>Privacy Principles</h2>
<p>We believe in your privacy. The "MapsON" App has been developed with the following principles in mind:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Data Minimization:</strong> We do not collect any personal information or usage data that could identify you.</li>
    <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> All data that you create or import into the App is stored <strong>exclusively on your device</strong>. We do not have access to this data.</li>
    <li><strong>No Data Transfer:</strong> The App does not transmit any of your data (geolocation, points, polygons, layers) to our servers or any third-party services.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Information Processed (Locally)</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Geolocation Data:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>When you grant permission, the App uses your device's location service to determine your current location.</li>
            <li>This information is used <strong>solely to display your real-time position on the map</strong> within the App.</li>
            <li>Geolocation data is processed locally on your device and is <strong>not stored by the App</strong> (except when you consciously save your current position as a point) and is <strong>not transmitted anywhere</strong>. You can revoke location access at any time in your device's Settings.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>User-Created Data:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Points (with names, descriptions, coordinates, types, etc.), Polygons (with names, vertex coordinates, etc.), and files you import (e.g., `.mbtiles`, `.csv`).</li>
            <li>This data is stored <strong>exclusively locally on your device</strong> in the App's internal storage. You have full control over this data: you can create, edit, and delete it. We do not have access to this data.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Purchase Information (In-App Purchases):</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>If you make an in-app purchase (e.g., to unlock premium features), the transaction is processed directly by Apple through your App Store account. We only receive confirmation of a successful purchase from Apple to activate the corresponding feature, but <strong>we do not receive any of your payment information</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
<p>All information is stored locally on your device. You are responsible for the security of your device and the data on it, including creating backups (via iCloud or locally) if necessary.</p>

<h2>Data Disclosure</h2>
<p>Since we do not collect or store your data outside of your device, we cannot disclose it to anyone.</p>

<h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by updating the "Effective Date". Your continued use of the App after such changes constitutes your acceptance of the new Privacy Policy.</p>

<h2>Contact Us</h2>
<p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us through the support page.</p>
